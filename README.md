# AndroidFingerprintExample
A simple android app to check out the new Android Fingerprint authentication.
The app has a single page with a button. The button is only enabled when there is hardware support for fingerprint scanning 
and if there are any enrolled fingerprints.

When the button is pressed, a dialog pops up asking the user to scan their fingerprint. 

If there is a match, the dialog is dismissed and a confirmation is displayed to the user.

Error handling has also been included.
